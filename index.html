<p> <b>The web</b>
<br>The web is a bunch of computers talking to one another.
<br>Additionally, the web is a collection of HTML (hyper texts markup language).
<br>Major components include; user, computer, internet , http server and browser.</p>
<p><b>HTML definition</b>
  <br>Hypertext-is what the user sees.
  <br>Markup- what the layout looks like i.e. tags.
  <br>Language- what the computers reads, i.e- images, video, etc.
</p>
<p><b>Markups</b>
  <br>Markups are coded in HTML as open and close statements and include < > brakckets.
  <br>The totality of these individual statements is called an element.
  <br>An element can consist of <a href="https://www.udacity.com">attributes</a>, images and videos.
</p>
<p><b>Additional Info</b>
  <br>White Spac- white space is how much space is seen between each statement and element. 
  <br>In HTML hitting the space button will not show variation in distance between text or attributes. 
  <br> Because computers are "stupid" in that they need specific commands, specific code is need to direct computer on how to display statements and elements.
  <br>Commands direct computers to follow an inline format, such as break, bold, <em>emphasis</em>, and attributes commands.
  <br> <b>Inline</b> commands are commands that have no set boundaries.
  <br>Conversly, <b>block</b> commands have specific height, and width parameters. 
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>
  <br>While many of the coding statements in HTML must include closing statements, there are exception i.e the br or break statement.
